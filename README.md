# PRIVADB: Empirical Analaysis of  IndexedDB with Dynamic Taint Analysis

**Detecting Persistent Web Tracking via IndexedDB — FYP Research Project**

A three-phase dynamic analysis pipeline that crawls websites, extracts IndexedDB storage data, and detects tracking identifier exfiltration using heuristic taint analysis. Implements the analytical framework from *"What Storage: An Empirical Analysis of Web Storage in the Wild"* adapted specifically for IndexedDB.

## Overview

Modern websites increasingly use **IndexedDB** — a powerful client-side NoSQL database — to store data in the browser. While designed for legitimate purposes (offline caching, app state), IndexedDB is also exploited by third-party trackers to persist unique identifiers that survive cookie clearing.

This tool:
1. **Crawls** target websites using a headless Chromium browser (Playwright)
2. **Extracts** all IndexedDB databases, object stores, and records
3. **Captures** all network requests made during the page load
4. **Detects** potential tracking identifiers stored in IndexedDB
5. **Traces** exfiltration of those identifiers via network requests (outflow flows)
6. **Detects** external data flowing into IndexedDB (inflow flows)
7. **Classifies** each flow by confinement, cross-origin status, and tracking confidence
8. **Generates** publication-quality reports, charts, and CSV exports

┌It needs to be updated, I removed the old one :)
```

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Chromium browser** (installed automatically by Playwright)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone or navigate to the project
cd /path/to/Static-Analysis/scratch

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Playwright browsers
playwright install chromium
```

### `requirements.txt`

```
playwright>=1.40.0
numpy>=1.24.0
pandas>=2.0.0
matplotlib>=3.7.0
```

---

## Usage

### Full Pipeline (Crawl + Detect + Report)

```bash
# Default: crawl sites from sites.json
python main.py

# Custom domain list
python main.py --input-file domains.txt

# Limit to first 10 sites
python main.py --sites 10

# Use a specific chunk file with 5 sites
python main.py --input-file domains2scan/chunk_008 --sites 5
```

### Individual Phases

```bash
# Crawl only (save raw data, skip analysis)
python main.py --crawl-only

# Detect + Report only (on existing crawled data)
python main.py --detect-only

# Detect only first 20 crawled sites
python main.py --detect-only --sites 20
```

### Overwrite Control

By default, the pipeline **prompts before overwriting** existing results:

```bash
# Will prompt: "Overwrite existing results? [y/N]"
python main.py --detect-only

# Skip the prompt, overwrite silently
python main.py --detect-only --overwrite
```

### Browser Debugging

```bash
# Show the browser window (non-headless)
python main.py --no-headless --sites 3
```

### 📊 Web Intelligence Dashboard (Real-time GUI)

The dashboard provides a high-fidelity, data-driven visualization of all exfiltration events, tracker maps, and paper metrics.

#### 1. Launch Backend (FastAPI)
```bash
# From project root:
cd Web/backend
python3 server.py
```
*Accessible at `http://localhost:8000`*

#### 2. Launch Frontend (Vite + React)
```bash
# From project root:
cd Web
npm run dev -- --port 8080
```
*Accessible at `http://localhost:8080`*

### All CLI Flags

| Flag | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `--input-file FILE` | Path to custom domain list (.txt or .json) | `sites.json` |
| `--sites N` | Limit to first N sites (crawl AND detect) | All |
| `--crawl-only` | Only crawl, skip detection and reporting | Off |
| `--detect-only` | Only detect/report on existing crawled data | Off |
| `--no-headless` | Show browser window for debugging | Headless |
| `--overwrite` | Overwrite existing results without prompting | Prompt |

### Test Cases (Manual Verification)

The `test_cases.py` script performs **live crawling + detection** on a small set of sites and produces a human-readable JSON report for manual verification.

```bash
# Run default test sites (~5 curated sites with known trackers)
python test_cases.py

# Test a specific URL
python test_cases.py --url https://example.com

# Test multiple URLs
python test_cases.py --url https://a.com --url https://b.com

# Show browser window
python test_cases.py --no-headless

# Run 2 crawl iterations per site (for diff analysis)
python test_cases.py --iterations 2
```

**Output:** A JSON report saved to `results/test_reports/test_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json` containing:

- **IndexedDB key:value pairs** — actual database records for cross-checking with browser DevTools
- **Detected trackers** — domain, request URL, status code, exfiltrated value, confidence level
- **All third-party requests** — with status codes and known-tracker flags
- **Inflow flows** — external data (navigator, URL params) written into IDB
- **Pass/Fail verdict** — per site, based on whether the expected tracker was detected

---

## Input Formats

### Plain Text (`.txt`)

One URL or domain per line. Lines starting with `#` are comments.

```text
# My target sites
https://example.com
google.com
www.tracker-test.com
```

### JSON (`.json`)

Either a list of URLs or an object with a `sites` key:

```json
["https://example.com", "google.com", "facebook.com"]
```

```json
{
  "sites": [
    {"url": "https://example.com", "reason": "popular site"},
    {"url": "https://tracker-test.org", "reason": "known tracker"}
  ]
}
```

### Chunk Files (`domains2scan/chunk_NNN`)

Pre-split domain lists (500 domains per chunk, ~1000 chunks). Use with `--input-file`:

```bash
python main.py --input-file domains2scan/chunk_008 --sites 50
```

## Glossary & Terminal Output Guide

When the pipeline finishes, it prints a comprehensive summary to the terminal. Here is a plain-English, beginner-friendly explanation of exactly what each section means.

### 1. 📊 AGGREGATE STATISTICS (pandas)
This is a high-level summary of the raw data collected across all the sites you just crawled.
* **IDB DBs:** The total number of IndexedDB databases found across all sites.
* **Records:** The total number of key-value pairs stored in those databases.
* **Net Reqs:** The total number of network requests the browser made while loading all these sites.
* **IDs Found:** The number of times the detector found a potential "identifier" (a string of text that looks like a tracking ID) stored inside IndexedDB.
* **Exfil (Exfiltrations):** The number of times one of those identifiers was caught being sent out to the internet in a network request. This is the core tracking event.
* **HIGH / MED / LOW:** How confident the scanner is that these exfiltrations are actually malicious tracking. 
* **Inflow:** The number of times external data (like a URL parameter) was saved *into* IndexedDB.
* **Internal / External:** Out of the exfiltrations, how many stayed on the same website (Internal) vs. how many were sent to a completely different website (External).

### 2. 🗄️ IndexedDB KEY:VALUE RECORDS
This shows the actual data that the websites stored inside your browser's IndexedDB. 
* It shows the domain (e.g., `accuweather.com`), exactly where it was stored (`pn_store` database), the name of the key (`id`, `tz`), and the actual value that was saved (`Asia/Karachi`).
* *Note:* The terminal only shows the first 10 records so it doesn't crash your screen. All valid records are saved safely in `results/indexeddb_records.json`.

### 3. 🌐 NETWORK REQUESTS CAPTURED
A summary of all the internet traffic generated by the sites.
* **Total requests:** The raw number of HTTP requests.
* **Third-party:** The percentage of requests that went to a different domain than the one you were visiting. 
* **Top third-party domains:** Shows which external companies are collecting the most data (e.g., `www.google.com`, `m.media-amazon.com`).

### 4. ⚠️ CONFIDENCE BREAKDOWN
A summary of the scoring applied to the "Exfil" events mentioned above.
* **HIGH (🔴):** We are highly certain this is tracking (e.g., sent to a known tracker domain).
* **MEDIUM (🟡):** Suspicious, but lacks definitive proof.
* **LOW (🟢):** Low risk (likely just the website talking to its own servers for harmless reasons).

### 5. 📡 TOP TRACKER DOMAINS
This lists the specific domains that were caught receiving data *out* of IndexedDB. 
* For example, if `b.6sc.co` is listed with 25 events, it means it received IndexedDB data 25 times across your scans.

### 6. 🏷️ IDENTIFIER TYPES DETECTED
This explains *why* the detector thought a piece of data in IndexedDB was worth tracking.
* **`idb_key:userid` / `idb_key:href`:** The data was stored under a highly suspicious key name.
* **`high_entropy`:** The string was mathematically random (like a UUID or token).

### 7. 🌐 OVERALL CLASSIFICATION
A quick funnel of your entire scan journey:
* **Total sites analyzed:** How many you started with.
* **Sites with IndexedDB:** How many actually used the database API.
* **Sites with exfiltration:** How many had data leave IndexedDB and go to the network.
* **Sites with HIGH tracking:** How many had a highly confident tracker detected.

### "WHAT STORAGE" PAPER — ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK RESULTS

This section formats your scan's data to exactly match the tables and math from the academic paper *"What Storage: An Empirical Analysis of Web Storage in the Wild"*, allowing you to compare your findings against their published research.

* **📄 FLOW OVERVIEW:** Breaks down the total flows into "Outflow" (data leaving the browser) and "Inflow" (data entering the database from the outside).
* **📊 TABLE III: CONFINEMENT:** Breaks down the Outflows. "Internal" means the data stayed on the same website. "External" means the data crossed origins (sent to another company).
* **📊 TABLE IV: EXTERNAL FLOWS BREAKDOWN:** Looks *only* at the External flows. It shows how many were purely "Cross-site" (sent to a totally unrelated company), and out of those, how many were confirmed blacklisted trackers.
* **📊 TRACKING vs NON-TRACKING:** Evaluates the Outflows. Shows what percentage of them hit a known blacklisted tracking domain.
* **📡 SINK CLASS DISTRIBUTION:** Tells you *how* the data left the browser (e.g., via a standard `network` request vs. stuffed into a `cookie`).
* **🗄️ TOP IndexedDB DATABASES:** The names of the specific databases that were involved in the most Outflows. (e.g., `mixpanelBrowserDb`).
* **📈 PAPER METRICS SUMMARY:** A final cheat sheet of all the key percentages that the academic paper reported, calculated using your specific dataset.

## Limitations

- **Heuristic-based**: Uses pattern matching and string search rather than true dynamic taint tracking (no JS instrumentation)
- **Single page load**: Only analyzes the initial page load; interactive flows (clicks, form submissions) are not captured
- **No Service Worker analysis**: IDB usage by service workers during background sync is not directly captured
- **String matching**: Identifier exfiltration is detected by substring matching, which can produce false positives for short or common strings
- **Navigator-only inflow**: Inflow detection currently only catches navigator properties and URL parameters, not network response → IDB flows
